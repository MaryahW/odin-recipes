    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Refrigerated cheese tortellini</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Minced garlic</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Reserved pasta water</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Chopped parsley and grated parm (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First things first: Bring a pot of water to boil for the tortellini. All it takes is about 3 minutes (for the store-bought kind, anyway) until it’s cooked. Then, use a slotted spoon to remove the tortellini or strain it, but either way, don’t dump out that pasta water! You’ll need it later to make the sauce. </li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic to the melted butter and stir for 1 minute, the garlic should be nice and fragrant. Sprinkle the flour to the melted butter and garlic and stir, stir, stir, until a paste (the roux) forms. At this point, you’ll gradually whisk in the milk or half and half until the paste smoothes out as the milk is fully incorporated. Add salt and pepper and ½ a cup of the reserved pasta water. </li>
            <li>The last step of the alfredo sauce-making is to add that lovely parmesan cheese! To the sauce, stir in the cheese a bit at a time and let it melt down and fully incorporate into the sauce. Add more pasta water (a little at a time) to make the sauce thin and pourable. Add in more salt and pepper if you wish, then put the tortellini back into the sauce, letting it heat through for about 2-3 minutes. Garnish with cracked black pepper, parsley and more parmesan if you like. </li>
        </ol>
