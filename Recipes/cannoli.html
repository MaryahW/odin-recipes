    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Deep fried pastry with a sweet, creamy filling. This classic Italian sweet treat is a definite crowd pleaser. Keep it classic with chocolate chips or add your own flair with fillings of your choice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cannoli shells</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup mini chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the ricotta cheese into a fine mesh strainer and place it in the fridge to drain for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the drained ricotta cheese, confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup of the mini chocolate chips, vanilla extract, and orange zest (if using); mix well. Using a spatula, carefully scrape the mixture into pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch open tip. Use at once, or refrigerate until needed; filling can be made up to 24 hours in advance.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, pipe the filling into one end of cannoli shell, filling shell halfway, then pipe into other end. If you don't have a piping bag, you may spoon the filling into the shells. Repeat with remaining shells.</li>
        <li>Place remaining mini chocolate chips on a small plate. Dip each end of the cannoli into the chocolate chips, then lightly dust with confectioner's sugar. Serve at once.</li>
    </ol>
